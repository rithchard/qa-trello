# QA Trello - Test Automation

This repository contains automated tests for the Trello application, covering both UI and API tests using Playwright.

## Prerequisites

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## Credentials Configuration

### UI Tests

To run UI tests, you need to provide valid user credentials for [trello.com]. These credentials should be set in the file:

- `fixtures/users.ts`

Example:
```typescript
export const users = {
  user1: {
    email: 'your-email@domain.com',
    password: 'your-password',
  }
};
```

### API Tests

To run API tests, you need Trello API access credentials. Set the following values in the file:

- `fixtures/credentials.ts`

Example:
```typescript
export const credentials = {
  API_KEY: 'your-api-key',
  TOKEN: 'your-token',
  ID_LIST: 'your-list-id'
};
```
